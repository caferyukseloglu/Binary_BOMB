# Binary_BOMB
## Marmara University CSE2138 - Project 2

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to become more familiar with machine level programming.
Each of you will work with a special “binary bomb”. A binary bomb is a program that consists of a sequence of phases.
Each phase expects you to type a particular string on stdin. If you type the correct string, then the phase is defused
and the bomb proceeds to the next phase. Otherwise, the bomb explodes by printing "BOOM!!!" and then
terminating. The bomb is defused when every phase has been defused.
There are too many bombs for us to deal with, so we are giving each of you a different bomb to defuse. Your mission
is to defuse your bomb before the due date. Below, the two steps of the project are explained in detail.
